# Sentimental Analysis


This project demonstrates how to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using machine learning techniques in Python.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and deploy a machine learning model that can detect whether an email is spam or not, based on its content. The solution includes:

- Text preprocessing using **NLTK** and **regex**
- Feature extraction with **TF-IDF**
- Training classification models (e.g., **SVM**, **Naive Bayes**)
- Saving the model and vectorizer
- Deploying a web app using **Flask**

## Project Workflow

### ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning
- Remove URLs, punctuation, special characters  
- Convert to lowercase  
- Remove stopwords  
- Lemmatize words

### ðŸ”¹ Feature Extraction
- Tokenize text  
- Apply **TF-IDF** vectorization

### ðŸ”¹ Model Training
- Train classifiers (e.g., **SVC**)  
- Evaluate using accuracy

### ðŸ”¹ Model Saving
- Save model & vectorizer using `joblib`

### ðŸ”¹ Deployment
- Build a simple Flask web app for real-time prediction
